# Exoplanet Exploration

**Background**
Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.
In this assignment I created a machine learning model to classify candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.
* I created two models.
* I preprocessed the raw data.
* I tuned the models.

There are 3 folders in this repository.
* data contains the data used in this project.
* code contains the Jupyter notebooks model_1.ipynb and model_2.ipynb
* models contains the models created by each notebook.

Each notebook starts with basic cleanup. 
The columns that had all null values were dropped. Rows that had all null values were dropped. 

Model 1 returned Training Data Score and Testing Data Score of 0.
Model 2 returned Training Data Score: 0.887659736791913 and Testing Data Score: 0.8895881006864989.
